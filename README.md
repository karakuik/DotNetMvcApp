# ASP.NET Core Project

Welcome to my ASP.NET Core project! This project is built following the official ASP.NET Core tutorial, and it's designed to showcase the power and flexibility of ASP.NET Core for building modern web applications.

## Overview

This project is a web application developed using ASP.NET Core, a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building web applications. It utilizes the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, allowing for a clean separation of concerns and easy management of application logic, presentation, and data.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be fully responsive and optimized for various devices and screen sizes.
- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Implement user authentication and authorization using ASP.NET Core Identity, allowing users to register, login, and access protected resources.
- **Data Persistence:** Utilize Entity Framework Core to interact with a database, enabling data storage and retrieval for the application.
- **CRUD Operations:** Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing data entities within the application.
- **Dependency Injection:** Leverage the built-in dependency injection container in ASP.NET Core for managing application services and dependencies.
